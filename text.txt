# Whiteboard Project README

## Overview
This is the README file for the final project in CS50x, a whiteboard application developed using Python Flask and Jinja templating. The project consists of three HTML files: `layout.html`, `home.html`, and `index.html`. The main functionality is centered around the `index.html` file, where the whiteboard is implemented.

## Project Structure
- **`layout.html`**: This file serves as the base template for the project, utilizing Python Flask and Jinja templating. It sets up the structure for the authentication pages, `home.html` and `index.html`.

- **`home.html`**: A visually engaging screen saver page with an animated canvas. The canvas code is inspired by Codeply, with significant modifications applied. The JavaScript for this canvas is located in `static/js/canv_h.js`.

- **`index.html`**: The main whiteboard implementation page. Users can choose various options, such as blank page background or several paper-lined backgrounds. The canvas for drawing is implemented here, along with buttons for actions like clear, undo, redo, size adjustment, color change, eraser, pencil, and file input to load images from the local drive. The JavaScript for this canvas is located in `static/js/canv.js`.

## File Structure
- **`static`**
  - **`js`**
    - **`canv.js`**: JavaScript file for the whiteboard canvas on `index.html`.
    - **`canv_h.js`**: JavaScript file for the animated canvas on `home.html`.
  - **`css`**
    - **`style.css`**: Stylesheet for the entire project.

- **`static`**
  - **`images`**: Folder containing images for paper-lined backgrounds.
